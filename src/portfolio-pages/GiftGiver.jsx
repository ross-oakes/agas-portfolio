                "The main problem users were facing when trying to find gifts was the fact that they needed to go to " +

                "irrelevant options provided to them. They needed someway of reducing this selection to make their " +
                "decision easier. I decided the way I would tackle this issue would be to use a combination of user " +
                "input and categories buttons.",

                "The decision of which categories to include stemmed from the user research and competitors " +
                "analysis. I asked participants to tell me who they bought presents for and found that the most " +
                "common answers were their mum, boyfriend, son, friends, etc; thus, providing me with a start to my " +
                "list. Other websites offered a similar classification, for instance, Him / Her / Mum / Son. The " +
                "problem with this classification is that it is gender binary. The issues will arise if, for example" +
                ", a man likes makeup and dresses. With such classification, the user could be lost as to which " +
                "category to select. However, with my categorisation, the items users already have will decide on " +
                "the most suitable gifts, rather than their gender. Overall, I decided to use three categories " +
                "'Partner', 'Family' and 'Friend', so that they will include gifts specific to a person's " +
                "relationship to another person. For example, a partner category will also include romantic gifts.",

                "I was thinking what is the best idea for users to input the person's favourite things. First of all" +
                ", I came up with as many as possible on my own. Then, I asked a few friends for their ideas as well" +
                ". At this stage I wanted to collect as many ideas as possible, therefore I asked them to think " +
                "freely, elimination would come later. Some of the ideas included: a list of categories and " +
                "subcategories, a text box, voice recognition, a dropdown. Typing in a text box seemed to be the " +
                "most appropriate, as it is the least time consuming. As the possibilities of things a person can " +
                "own are endless, the input would not work as a dropdown, and it would be tedious to click through " +
                "a hierarchy of categories too for every item. Furthermore, it would be beneficial if the input box " +
                "could provide autofill suggestions when users began to type. This would help to make the text input " +
                "quicker, avoid typos and prompt users to type in things that are already in the system. If users " +
                "type in an unrecognisable item, the system should come up with similar suggestions and inform the " +
