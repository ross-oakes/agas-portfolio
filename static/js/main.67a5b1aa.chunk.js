The issues would arise if, for example, a man liked makeup and dresses. It was not necessary to state someone's gender as the items they already owned would decide on the most suitable gifts.

Some of the ideas included: a list of categories and subcategories, a text box, voice recognition, a dropdown. Typing in a text box seemed to be the most appropriate, as it is the least time consuming. As the possibilities of things a person can own are endless, the input would not work as a dropdown, and it would be tedious to click through a hierarchy of categories too for every item. Furthermore, it would be beneficial if the input box could provide autofill suggestions when users began to type. This would help to make the text input quicker, avoid typos and prompt users to type in things that are already in the system.
